# SVG-Shape-Generator-W10

## Description

In this week, we were tasked to take input from a user and create a logo depending on the input. The logo is created using an svg file, and users have the selection of a triangle, circle, or square for the shape. The user can also input three letters that they would like to appear on the logo in the center of the shape. The user may also choose the color of both the shape and the text. After all the input is taken, an SVG file is created called logo.svg.

## Installation

Uses the inquirer, jest, and fs node packages

## Usage

This application can be used to create a simple logo for a company. The colors and text can be changed by the user as well.
